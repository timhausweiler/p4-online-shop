## Overview

I was thinking about what to do for my P4 for a while because I would want it to be a project that I can keep working on even after the completion of our course. The plan would be to build an MVP-version of the shop that fulfills all of the requirements for my P4 and to improve it with all different kinds of functions in the future.

<br>

## MVP

The MVP will fulfill all of the minimum requirements of our P4. As such users will be able to

- browse the range of products being offered in ths shop
- create and edit a user account
- offer their own products and edit them after the initial creation and
- leave, edit and delete reviews for all the products being offered

<br>

## Post-MVP

In the future I would like to expand the shop's functionality continuously - some ideas for additional functions include:

- Sort products by different properties
- Filter products by different properties
- Restriction to posting products to an admin user
- Basket functionality: add products to a basket
- Wishlist functionality: add products to a wishlist
- Checkout process
- Purchase history
- A user section: see previous orders, edit profile, ...
