## Overview

I was thinking about what to do for my P4 for a while because I would want it to be a project that I can keep working on even after the completion of our course. The plan would be to build an MVP-version of the shop that fulfills all of the requirements for my P4 and to improve it with all different kinds of functions in the future.

<br>

## MVP

The MVP will fulfill all of the minimum requirements of our P4. As such users will be able to

- browse the range of products being offered in ths shop
- create and edit a user account
- offer their own products and edit them after the initial creation and
- leave, edit and delete reviews for all the products being offered

<br>

## Post-MVP

In the future I would like to expand the shop's functionality continuously - some ideas for additional functions include:

- Basket functionality: add products to a basket
- Wishlist functionality: add products to a wishlist
- Sort products by different properties
- Filter products by different properties
- A user section: see previous orders, edit profile, ...
- Restriction to posting products to an admin user

<br>

## Setup

### Libraries and Dependencies

|    Library    | Description           |
| :-----------: | :-------------------- |
|     React     | Frontend              |
| React Router  | Frontend routes       |
| Ruby on Rails | Backend functionality |
|    Flexbox    | Frontend styling      |
|     Axios     | API calls             |

<br>

### Wireframes

Please find the wireframes for the different views [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AOT1QSE50i93WtLJ4hEP-0BHqaYKHXdDc5tmuaDgWc8/edit#slide=id.p).

### Component Tree

Please find the Component Tree [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AOT1QSE50i93WtLJ4hEP-0BHqaYKHXdDc5tmuaDgWc8/edit#slide=id.g11707c61e37_0_0).

#### Component Architecture

> Use this section to define your React components and the data architecture of your app. This should be a reflection of how you expect your directory/file tree to look like.

```structure

src
|__ assets/
      |__ fonts
      |__ graphics
      |__ images
      |__ mockups
|__ components/
      |__ Header.jsx
|__ services/

```

#### Time Estimates

> Use this section to estimate the time necessary to build out each of the components you've described above.

| Task                | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| ------------------- | :------: | :------------: | :-----------: | :---------: |
| Add Contact Form    |    L     |     3 hrs      |     2 hrs     |    3 hrs    |
| Create CRUD Actions |    H     |     3 hrs      |     1 hrs     |     TBD     |
| TOTAL               |          |     6 hrs      |     3 hrs     |     TBD     |

> _Why is this necessary? Time frames are key to the development cycle. You have limited time to code your app, and your estimates can then be used to evaluate possibilities of your MVP and post-MVP based on time needed. It's best you assume an additional hour for each component, as well as a few hours added to the total time, to play it safe._

### Server (Back End)

#### ERD Model

> Use this section to display an image of a computer generated ERD model. You can use draw.io, Lucidchart or another ERD tool.
